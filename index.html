      <h2>Hello There.</h2>
      <p class="">Hi I’m <b>Nabil Farhan</b>, an average 20 year old in a state college who sees life as an adventure. Most of the time, you’ll find me sitting outside staring at people, which can be creepy to many—when in my mind, I am being the scientist I am to observe and learn more about my surroundings everyday. To be honest, humans are fascinating.
      <br>

      As an fairly young adult, I love to discuss about deep topics involving psychology, human behavior, life, and also, hearing about other people’s perspectives to the point that I will explore controversies and carry them into the conversation with other people. Of course, I do consider the fact that not everyone is comfortable with discussing controversies, but no problem, I can see that within people.</p>
