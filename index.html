            Hi I’m Nabil Farhan, an average 20 year old in a state college who
            sees life as an adventure. Most of the time, you’ll find me sitting
            outside staring at people, which can be creepy to many—when in my
            mind, I am being the scientist I am to observe and learn more about
            my surroundings everyday. To be honest, humans are fascinating. As
            an fairly young adult, I love to discuss about deep topics involving
            psychology, human behavior, life, and also, hearing about other
            people’s perspectives to the point that I will explore controversies
            and carry them into the conversation with other people. Of course, I
            do consider the fact that not everyone is comfortable with
            discussing controversies, but no problem, I can see that within
            people.
